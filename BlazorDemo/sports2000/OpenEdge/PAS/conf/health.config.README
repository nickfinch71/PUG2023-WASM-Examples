---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The health.config file is JSON and as such, must be valid JSON. Please 
verify all changes with a JSON validator.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are other values in the appserver.properties file that are documented
there. These work with the values in this file. These are the comments, see
the appserver.properties file for the parameters and values.

# PAS health collector enable
# PAS health collector configuration file
# PAS health collector delay before starting polling
# PAS health collector wait on shutdown for polls to complete
# PAS health collector polling interval

# The timeout for polling each individual probe in milliseconds.
# A value of -1 sets the timeout as # Probes/ Interval
# A value of zero means no timeout.

Please use "tcman config" to change these values.

NOTES:
1) The health of a probe is _NOT_ its calculated value
	Health is calculated using your fullHealth and extremalHealth settings
	Example: The memory may be 85% but the Memory Health Score will be 50% when
		fullHealth=0.8
		extremalHealth=0.9
2) If you want the HealthScanner to be critical when a specific probe or
	probe collection becomes critical set failonCritical="true". This will 
	cause the whole HealthScanner score to be failed. 
3) Some probes are considered "experimental" and are not enabled by default

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

name	
		The name of the proble or probe collection
		
		Character field - must have double-quotes around the name
		
probeID	
		A unique integer value for each probe, including composites
		
		Numeric value - Values from 1 to 1000 are reserved for use by Progress
						For custom probes, specify a unique value > 1000.
		
description	

		The description of the probe or probe collection
		
		Character field - must have double-quotes around the name

comments
		Additional comments for the probe or probe collection
		
		Character field - must have double-quotes around the name
		
calculation
		The description of the calculation of the metric
		
		Character field - must have double-quotes around the name
		
className
		The class name of the probe or probe collection
		
		*** DO NOT CHANGE ***
		
weight
		The relative importance 
			- if a probe, relative to other probes in the probe collection
			- if a probe collection, relative to other collections
		
		Numeric Value - from 0.0 to 1.0 (no quotes)
		
fullHealth
		Threshold where the calculated value always shows a Health value of 1.0
		
		Numeric Value - from 0.0 to 1.0 (no quotes)
		
		Example: If memory probe fullHealth=0.8 then the probe health will show
		100% (1.0) until memory usage hits 80%. Then the probe health will
		decline proportionally until it gets to 0% at the extremalHealth 
		setting.
		
extremalHealth
		Threshold where the calculated value always shows a Health value of 0.0 
		
		Numeric Value - from 0.0 to 1.0 (no quotes)
		
marginal
		Threshold where a probe or probe collection's health is considered 
		marginal
			Sets YELLOW color to heatmap
		
		Numeric Value - from 0.0 to 1.0 (no quotes)
		
critical
		A threshold where a probe or probe collection's healthis considered 
		critical
			Sets RED color to heatmap
		
		Numeric Value - from 0.0 to 1.0 (no quotes)
		
failOnCritical
		"true" - when probe or probe collection is critical the whole health 
			check metric is also set to critical
		"false" - when probe or probe collection is critical it does not set
			the whole health check metric to critical
			
		Logical Value - either "false" or "true" requires double-quotes

enabled
		"true" - enables the probe or probe collection to be calculated
			and contribute to the whole health calculation
		"false" - disables the probe or probe collection and no calculation
			will be done and it will not affect the whole health calculation
			
		Logical Value - either "false" or "true" requires double-quotes

This section for "GCUsedMemoryTrend Health" probe only

This probe has a sliding time scale to evaluate Garbage collection over the
last number of polling intervals
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

safeFuture
		Safe number of Future objects in memory
		
		Integer value - (no quotes)

timeToStart
		Number of polling intervals before starting to evaluate probe
		
		Integer value - (no quotes)
		
numberOfIntervals
		Number of polling intervals to use to evaluate probe
		
		Integer value - (no quotes)
		
minNumberOfIntervals
		Minimum number of polling intervals to evaluate probe
		
		Integer value - (no quotes)
